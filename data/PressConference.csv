May 1, 2019
CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. At the FOMC meeting that 
concluded today, we reviewed economic and financial developments in the United States and 
around the world and decided to leave our policy interest rate unchanged. 
My colleagues and I have one overarching goal: to use our monetary policy tools to 
sustain the economic expansion with a strong job market and stable prices for the benefit of the 
American people. Incoming data since our last meeting in March have been broadly in line with 
our expectations. Economic growth and job creation have both been a bit stronger than we 
anticipated, while inflation has been somewhat weaker. Overall, the economy continues on a 
healthy path, and the Committee believes that the current stance of policy is appropriate. 
The Committee also believes that solid underlying fundamentals are supporting the 
economy, including accommodative financial conditions, high employment and job growth, 
rising wages, and strong consumer and business sentiment. Job gains rebounded in March after a 
weak reading in February and averaged 180,000 per month in the first quarter, well above the 
pace needed to absorb new entrants to the labor force. Although first-quarter GDP rose more 
than most forecasters had expected, growth in private consumption and business fixed
investment slowed. Recent data suggest that these two components will bounce back, supporting 
our expectation of healthy GDP growth over the rest of the year. 
The Committee is strongly committed to our symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. For 
much of this long expansion, inflation ran a bit below our 2 percent objective, alongside 
considerable slack in resource utilization. But last year, with the unemployment rate at or below 
4 percent, inflation moved up. From March through December, core inflation—which excludes 
volatile food and energy components—was at or very close to 2 percent. Overall inflation ,fluctuated from a few tenths above 2 percent to a few tenths below over this period, with the 
moves mostly due to changes in energy prices. As expected, overall inflation fell at the start of 
this year as earlier oil price declines worked through the system. Overall inflation for the 
12 months ended in March was 1.5 percent. Core inflation unexpectedly fell as well, however, 
and as of March stood at 1.6 percent for the previous 12 months. We suspect that some 
transitory factors may be at work. Thus, our baseline view remains that, with a strong job market 
and continued growth, inflation will return to 2 percent over time and then be roughly symmetric 
around our longer-term objective. 
At the start of the year, a number of crosscurrents presented risks to the outlook, 
including weak global growth, particularly in China and Europe; the possibility of a disruptive 
Brexit; and uncertainty around unresolved trade negotiations. While concerns remain in all of 
these areas, it appears that risks have moderated somewhat. Global financial conditions have 
eased, supported in many places around the world by an accommodative shift in monetary policy 
and, in some cases, fiscal policy. Recent data from China and Europe show some improvement, 
and the prospect of a disorderly Brexit has been pushed off for now. Further, there are reports of 
progress in the trade talks between the United States and China. The Committee views these 
developments, along with the outlook for continued growth, a strong job market, and muted 
inflation pressures, as consistent with continued patience in assessing further adjustments in 
monetary policy. 
Over the past several months, we have made a number of consequential decisions about 
our balance sheet. In January, we decided to continue implementing monetary policy using our 
current policy regime, which involves providing an ample supply of reserves. In March, we 
decided to slow the pace of balance sheet runoff, starting this month, and to cease runoff entirely ,in September. These plans support our longer-run dual-mandate objectives and also provide 
clarity about the path of our asset holdings. 
Today we had a preliminary discussion about the longer-run maturity composition of the 
portfolio. Before the financial crisis, our portfolio was weighted toward shorter-term debt of the 
federal government. In the wake of the crisis, the Fed bought a large amount of longer-term 
securities with the aim of lowering longer-term interest rates and, thus, supporting the recovery. 
Because of these purchases, our portfolio is now weighted toward longer-term securities. As part 
of normalization, we will have to decide what the maturity structure should be in the longer term. 
This choice raises many complex issues and has possible implications for the stance of policy. 
Today’s preliminary discussion laid the groundwork for more complete analysis and 
discussion, and we plan to return to the maturity composition question toward the end of the 
year. There is no pressing need to resolve this matter, however, and any decisions we ultimately 
reach will be implemented with considerable advance notice and in a manner that allows for 
smooth adjustment. As we have often emphasized, adjustments to the balance sheet 
normalization process may well be needed as the process unfolds. 
Finally, we made a small technical adjustment in one of our tools for implementing 
monetary policy: the interest rate on excess reserves, or IOER rate. The change does not reflect 
any shift in the intended stance of monetary policy. We use the IOER rate to help keep the 
federal funds rate in our target range. As balance sheet normalization continues, we have 
expected that the effective federal funds rate would shift up over time relative to the IOER rate. 
Last year we twice lowered the IOER rate by 5 basis points relative to the top of the target range 
after the federal funds rate moved toward the top of the range. These actions helped keep the 
effective federal funds rate well within the target range. And today we made one more such ,change. The target range for the federal funds rate is our main indicator of the stance of policy, 
and it remains unchanged. 
Thank you very much. I will be glad to take your questions.
STEVE LIESMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Steve Liesman, CNBC. As the statement 
noted, core inflation is now running below 2 percent—it’s been falling for three straight months,
and while you’ve been close, it’s only been at 2 percent or above one month since 2012. Mr. 
Chair, I guess I wonder, is it time to address low inflation through policy, and can you give us 
some sense of your metric for when it would be time? At what level would it require a policy 
response from the Committee? 
CHAIR POWELL. So, first, we are strongly committed to our 2 percent inflation 
objective and to achieving it on a sustained and symmetric basis. As I mentioned, we think our 
policy stance is appropriate at the moment, and we don’t see a strong case for moving in either 
direction. I would point out that inflation actually ran—including core inflation—actually ran 
pretty close to 2 percent for much of 2018. 
As you point out, both headline and core, though, did come in on the soft side in the first 
quarter, and that was not expected as it relates to core. So we say in our Statement of LongerRun Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy that the Committee would be concerned if inflation 
were running persistently above or below 2 percent. So “persistent” carries the sense of 
something that’s not transient, something that will sustain over a period of time. And in this 
case, as we look at these readings in the first quarter for core, we do see good reasons to think 
that some or all of the unexpected decrease may wind up being transient. And I’d point to things 
like portfolio management, service prices, apparel prices, and other things. In addition, the ,trimmed mean measures of inflation did not go down as much. Indeed, the Dallas trimmed mean 
is at 2 percent. 
But to go back to your question, if we did see a persistent—inflation running persistently 
below, then that is something the Committee would be concerned about and something that we 
would take into account in setting policy. 
SAM FLEMING. Thanks very much. Sam Fleming from the Financial Times. Let me 
carry on on the same theme. There’s obviously been a lot of speculation in the markets about the 
prospects for a rate reduction this year. Do you think markets have effectively gotten ahead of 
themselves on this? And what sort of economic conditions would you need to see to give serious 
consideration of a rate cut? The discussion, for example, about the 1995 example—do you 
actually need to see a looming recession to cut rates, or could an insurance cut be appropriate? 
Thanks. 
CHAIR POWELL. So as I mentioned, we’ve just come through a two-day meeting, and 
we’ve done a deep dive on economic and financial conditions in the United States and around the 
world and thought about our policy, and we do think our policy stance is appropriate right now. 
We don’t see a strong case for moving in either direction. So— we do, of course, though—as a 
routine matter, as you well know—we look not only at our baseline, but we also look at 
alternative simulations, both better and worse, and we ask ourselves what the appropriate policy 
response would be. But that’s all we do. And I would just say that we’re comfortable—the 
Committee is comfortable with our current policy stance. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi. Howard Schneider with Reuters. Shifting gears a little 
bit, I wondered if you could flesh out—I know you’re describing it as a small technical 
adjustment, but on the IOER federal funds spread, give us a sense of why it matters whether or ,not this breaches the upper limit a little bit. Is there any feed-through to broader credit 
conditions and financial conditions that you worry about, or is it simply a matter of the Fed 
showing that it can control what it says it’s controlling? And I do have a follow-up. 
CHAIR POWELL. So a small, temporary deviation outside of the range would really 
carry no—wouldn’t be important, as your question suggests. But we do think it’s important that 
we be able to control the federal funds rate and generally keep it within the range. That’s just 
good monetary policy, good monetary control. So we think it’s important, and we have the tools 
to do that, so we’ve used them again today. And, again, this is just a technical fix. It really has 
no implications for policy. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER. But as a follow-up on this, it is demonstrating that you can 
control the market you want to control. And I guess the question is, at what point would these 
steady declines in the IOER—steady widening of this spread, if it continues, essentially become 
the policy choice? 
CHAIR POWELL. Yes, I mean—so, generally speaking, the federal funds rate—we 
control only directly the federal funds rate in terms of the market rate. And the transmission of 
the federal funds rate into other short-term rates—money market rates—has been very good over 
a long period of time. And that’s important, because it’s really broader financial conditions that 
matter, not so much precisely the federal funds rate. So I think the Fed controlling the federal 
funds rate is actually important from that standpoint, and I don’t see us not controlling it. So I 
think we’ll continue to control it, and it will continue to transmit well into broader financial 
conditions. 
MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee with Bloomberg. I’m curious about the financial
conditions that you see out there. The minutes of the March meeting tell us “a few” officials,worried about financial stability risks. Was there a broader discussion at this meeting? Any 
consensus on whether such risks are growing as the markets hit new highs, and we do see some 
instability in short-end trading—is it possible that rates are too low at this point? 
CHAIR POWELL. We actually have a financial stability briefing and opportunity for 
comment every other meeting. So we had our quarterly briefing today—yesterday, as a matter of 
fact—and had that discussion as well. And I think there haven’t been a lot of changes since the 
last meeting, but I’ll just go through the way we think about it. First, we’ve developed and 
published our framework for assessing financial stability vulnerabilities—put it out for comment 
and welcome any feedback that we get from the public. And that enables us to focus our 
assessments regularly on the same things so that we can be held accountable and be transparent.
So there are four aspects of it that I’ll go through quickly, but I’d say that the headline 
really is that while there are some concerns around nonfinancial corporate debt, really the finding 
is that, overall, financial stability vulnerabilities are moderate, on balance. And, in addition, I 
would say that the financial system is quite resilient to shocks of various kinds with high capital 
and liquidity. But the four things we look at are, first, asset prices. And as for asset prices, some 
asset prices are somewhat elevated, but I would say not extremely so. 
Leverage in the financial sector—I mentioned households are actually in good shape 
from a leverage standpoint. Default rates are low. Borrowing is relatively low. Nonfinancial 
corporates is an area that we’ve spotlighted and focused on for attention, and there are concerns 
about that—not so much from a financial stability standpoint, but from the standpoint that having 
a highly levered corporate sector could be an amplifier for a downturn. ,And then the last two—the last two things are really about the leverage in the financial 
system and funding risk, and those are both very, very low by historic standards in the United 
States. So, on balance, in my view, vulnerabilities are moderate. 
MICHAEL MCKEE. If I could follow up on that—I’m just curious as to whether the 
level of asset prices is a reason why you might not be interested in cutting rates.
CHAIR POWELL. So we do say that risks to the financial system—we say in our 
longer-run statement of goals and monetary policy strategy that risks to the financial system that 
could prevent us from achieving our goals are something that we do take into consideration. I 
would say that, though, that really the tools for addressing those concerns are better—capital 
liquidity, good supervision, good stress testing, and things like that. Those are better first-order 
tools to deal with these kinds of issues than monetary policy. 
NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos of the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, with the 
benefit of hindsight, did last year’s rate increases make it harder for the Fed to credibly affirm its 
2 percent symmetric inflation target is not, in fact, a ceiling? And, if so, would it be appropriate 
to lower rates if core inflation remained persistently closer to 1½ percent instead of 2 percent?
And, if not, do you worry about any unwelcome tightening in real rates, given the recent softness 
in core inflation? 
CHAIR POWELL. So, to your first question, if you go back and think about the middle 
of last year, inflation was at 2 percent and appeared to be staying there. And the economy was 
quite strong and was growing strong. The fiscal changes were hitting the economy in a very 
positive way. And so I think the expectation was that inflation would remain up around 
2 percent. The weak first quarter performance was not expected—of core was not expected, and 
I don’t think is related to anything we did, in terms of raising rates. It appears to be more—we ,don’t know this, but you never know until—with hindsight, with perfect hindsight, but some of it 
does appear to be transient or idiosyncratic. Now, the second part of your question? Sorry. 
NICK TIMIRAOS. Well, I mean, if it was an issue, would it be appropriate to lower 
rates if core inflation held closer to 1½ percent? And, if not, are you worried that there is 
unwanted tightening from real rates, being where they are? 
CHAIR POWELL. Yes, I mean—so, as I said earlier, we do address this in our, sort of,
constitutional document. If inflation were to run persistently below 2 percent or persistently 
above 2 percent, that would be a concern for the Committee, and the Committee would take that 
into account in making policy. I do think it’s important that inflation run close to and sustainably 
—for a sustained period of time—and symmetrically around 2 percent. Because if it doesn’t, 
you run the risk that inflation expectations can—it has been the case, most of the misses are on 
the downside—inflation expectations over time could be pulled down, and that could put 
downward pressure on inflation and make it harder for us to react to downturns and harder for us 
to, you know, support the economy in difficult times. 
JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek, New York Times. So as you just mentioned, last 
year when you guys were kind of getting inflation coming in around 2 percent, you had this 
benefit of the tailwind of fiscal stimulus. And you still have that to some extent, although the tax 
cuts have mostly feeded through—we’ve still got something in the pipeline from the spending 
cap increases. So, I guess, how do you think about inflation as that fiscal benefit wanes toward 
the end of this year? 
CHAIR POWELL. Inflation, first of all—month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter—is going 
to move around. There will always be factors hitting it. So probably the biggest single factor 
driving it is the rate of underlying inflation or the closely related idea of where inflation ,expectations are anchored—the thought being, that’s where inflation will go in the long run if it’s 
not been pushed by those other factors. So we also think that slack—the level of slack in the 
economy does play some small role. It’s actually still a measurable role. It’s nothing like it was 
in the 1960s when the Phillips curve was quite steep, so that’s also something that plays a role. 
And so we take all those things into account, and the part of it that we can control is the 
slack part. And, again, we do expect that this reading will be transient and inflation will move 
back up. And if it isn’t and if it runs persistently below 2 percent for a sustained period, then 
that’s something we’d take into account in setting policy. 
DONNA BORAK. Chairman Powell, Donna Borak with CNN. Pivoting a little bit—
about wages, since 2010, women’s real earnings have gone up about 3.9 percent compared to 
men’s, which have risen about 2.1. Do you think the relative increase in women’s wages is a 
problem for the U.S. economy? 
CHAIR POWELL. You know, I think, generally, I’d have to see the data on that. It 
sounds like you picked a particular time frame. Over time, I really wonder whether that’s the 
case. You know, I think men and women should make the same for the same work, by and large. 
So—
DONNA BORAK. Just to push a little bit on this. But if the data shows that women’s 
wages are rising higher, is there a damage to the U.S. economy if male’s wages are declining or 
not growing as fast as women’s? 
CHAIR POWELL. So I think we’re getting in here to commenting on a nominee to the 
Fed indirectly, and that’s something I’d rather avoid. It’s really not my role to engage with 
potential nominees to the Fed, so I’m really not going to go there. I haven’t seen this research 
either, so I don’t really—really know. Thanks.,VICTORIA GUIDA. Victoria Guida with Politico. I wanted to ask—early last month, I 
believe it was April 2, the Fedwire® system went down. And I was just wondering if you could 
talk about what happened there, how long it lasted, whether you know what happened, whether 
you’re still looking into it, and whether it’s something that could happen again.
CHAIR POWELL. Sure. So that’s right. I want to say it was April 1, but it may have 
been April 2. In any case, the Fedwire® did go down for a few hours, in the three- or four-hour 
range. We were able to quickly identify the problem: It was an internal problem, and we were 
able to correct it and make changes so that that problem and other problems like it cannot repeat 
themselves. So, you know, we learn from these instances. They’re fairly rare, but we learn from 
them, and in this case it was internal, and it’s been corrected. 
STEVE MATTHEWS. Steve Matthews with Bloomberg. Next month, we have the 10th 
anniversary of the end of the recession, and there are some countries that have had expansions 
for 15, 20, 25 years. Do you think that’s something that’s practical for the U.S., that we could 
have that kind of lengthy expansion? And for you personally, if we had a recession during your 
tenure, would you consider that a failure? 
CHAIR POWELL. You know, I wouldn’t want to speculate. There’s always the 
example of Australia that everyone, I think, is aware of, where I think they’re in year 28 of their 
expansion. So things are possible. All I can see is that we have an economy where the 
expansion is continuing. Growth is at a healthy level. The labor market is strong. We see job 
creation. We see wages moving up. Inflation is low, which gives us the ability to be patient, and 
we do expect it to move up, and we want it to move up to 2 percent. So I see us on a good path 
for this year. ,STEVE MATTHEWS. Do you see parallels with the 1990s, when—for example, some 
people have pointed out, in the U.S., the longest expansion before this one, there was a rate cut in 
1995, and rates went up, and then they came down, and there was that kind of management. Do 
you see similarities in today’s situation? 
CHAIR POWELL. Similarities in the length. I mean, the situations were quite different 
then. This was before inflation really was under control, but, you know, it’s very interesting to 
look at the history. I find it quite interesting to look at different periods. But I think, in our own 
cycle, we face a particular set of challenges that are really what’s relevant for us now. 
MARTIN CRUTSINGER. Mr. Chairman, Marty Crutsinger with the AP. You’ve 
repeatedly said that the Fed’s going to conduct monetary policy without regard to outside 
political pressure, but it seems like the President is intent on increasing that political pressure. 
Yesterday, he said you should cut rates a full percentage point and start quantitative easing. 
What do those comments do, in terms of affecting how you pursue policy and how you convey 
your decisions to the public? 
CHAIR POWELL. Yes, so, as you know, we are a nonpolitical institution, and that 
means we don’t think about short-term political considerations, we don’t discuss them, and we 
don’t consider them in making our decisions one way or the other. And what we’re always 
solving for in our process, in our work, is to carry out our mission, which is to extend the 
economic expansion, keep the labor market strong, and get inflation around 2 percent. 
So to give you an idea of what our process is like, maybe as a way of putting all that in 
context—so for the past maybe 10 days, all 17 FOMC members will have made extensive 
preparations: catching up on the latest data, reading all the memos, talking to their colleagues 
and their staff. As you also are I’m sure aware, Marty, we talk to literally thousands of ,businesspeople and market people and people in the nonprofit sector and the educational sector 
just to get a better sense of the economy. We put all that together, and we come together for 
two days. 
The first day begins with an economic briefing, which is, sort of, economic and financial 
developments in the United States and around the world. That takes up most of the first day, and 
we talk about this in great detail. We go away, we think about that, and we come back, and the 
next day we talk about monetary policy. And in this particular case, we came to a unanimous 
decision, after an extensive discussion, that our monetary policy stance is appropriate where it is. 
And we think our monetary policy stance is in a good place, and we’re going to be patient as we 
consider adjustments. And we also see, by the way, the evolving-risk picture as very consistent 
with that outlook. 
So we don’t feel like the data’s pushing us in either direction. Of course, we’ll not 
hesitate if we do feel that the data justify moving in either direction. But that’s our process. 
That’s how we think about things. We don’t think about other factors. We don’t let them into 
our decisionmaking. We don’t discuss them. 
PAUL KIERNAN. Paul Kiernan from Dow Jones Newswires. Thanks for the question. 
In the last 23 years, core PCE inflation has run above 2 percent only during the period that 
coincided with the housing bubble. I’d like to know what you would say to people who worry 
that it will prove difficult for the Fed to lift inflation without potentially stoking another asset 
bubble of some sort. Thank you. 
CHAIR POWELL. Yes. So you’re pointing to, really, the fact that in recent years 
inflation has moved down and down, and, really, many major central banks have struggled to 
reach their inflation goals from below. And that includes us, although we’ve actually done—,we’ve come closer, I think, than most others. And it’s just a question, I think, of demographic 
and other large and, in some cases, global forces that are disinflationary to some extent, and it 
creates significant challenges. One, I would say, is, it means that interest rates will be lower—
will be closer to the effective lower bound more of the time because that means lower interest 
rates. And that’s one of the reasons we’re having a review of our monetary policy strategies, 
tools, and communications this year—to think about that problem. 
You mentioned the connection to financial stability of lower-for-longer rates, and that is 
another challenge. As I mentioned earlier, we do consider financial stability concerns to the 
extent they threaten achievement of our goals, but we also view, and I do take the view that 
macroprudential and supervisory tools, regulatory tools, things like the stress tests that we can do 
right through the cycle—those are really the best defense against financial instability so that the 
financial system is highly resilient to the kinds of financial shocks that can happen. 
GREG ROBB. Thank you. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. This morning, the ISM
manufacturing index fell to have its worst reading since October 2016. So isn’t that a dark cloud 
on your outlook for strong growth for the rest of the year? I mean, how much weight does it 
hold for you, and is it a sign that monetary policy might be too tight? 
CHAIR POWELL. This is the ISM reading, I guess from this morning, on 
manufacturing. Yes, we see that reading as—it’s still a positive reading and consistent with what 
we expect from the manufacturing sector, which is moderate or perhaps modest growth. 
Manufacturing has been weak all around the world. Services have been growing faster. So 
it’s—yes, it’s something that we are watching carefully, but we do expect a positive contribution 
to growth from the manufacturing sector. ,EDWARD LAWRENCE. Edward Lawrence from Fox Business. Thank you, Mr. 
Chairman, for doing this. You mentioned—talked about domestic growth a little bit with the 
economy. You mentioned that the progress in the talks with China trade, progress in talks with 
Japanese trade, the USMCA is moving or going to move through Congress. Could you talk 
about a little bit of the domestic growth that you’re seeing going forward for the rest of the year? 
And could these trade deals turn into tailwinds for the economy? 
CHAIR POWELL. Our outlook and my outlook is for—is a positive one, is a healthy 
one for the U.S. economy for growth for the rest of this year. And I would say that the basis for 
that, really, is consumer spending and business investment. So if you look at consumer 
spending, you saw stronger retail sales, stronger motor vehicle sales in March. And, as I 
mentioned, the conditions, the broader economic fundamentals, are strong in support of 
consumer spending—that’s more accommodative financial conditions, high confidence readings, 
high levels of employment, wages going up. All those things are going to support consumer 
spending. So that’s a significant part of the outlook this year. And business investment should 
also be positive in that sort of direction. 
In terms of the effect of trade deals, I think one thing would be that the resolution of the 
uncertainty around these trade negotiations would, I would guess, be a positive for business 
sentiment. We have been hearing from our business contacts, really, a lot since the beginning of 
the trade negotiations that uncertainty is a concern. If you import metals or whatever for your 
product or export your product, then it’s been a challenge for you. So that would be a positive. 
And, of course, most of the gains, though, I would expect, even from a successful trade 
negotiation, would come in over time. You know, I don’t think—it wouldn’t be the kind of thing 
where you’d immediately feel big effects right away, but they could be quite important over a ,longer period. So that, I think—that would be my expectation. I don’t know, though. I haven’t 
seen—none of us, at least I haven’t seen, the details of what’s been negotiated. 
DON LEE. Don Lee with the L.A. Times. Getting back to inflation, can you talk more 
about the transitory factors holding down inflation, how significant they are, and why you think 
those factors will pass? 
CHAIR POWELL. Sure. Well, I would just mention a couple. Let me say, I don’t mean 
to diminish concerns about too-low inflation, but I think there’s good reason to think that these 
readings are particularly influenced by some transitory factors. 
One that I would mention is portfolio management services, which would tend to go 
down when asset prices go down, with a lag. And so when asset prices went back up, probably 
there’ll be a swing around there, a positive contribution. Other ones that get mentioned are 
things like apparel, and apparel prices were very, very low. There was a change in the 
methodology. And another one is airfares. There are many little things. So we don’t know 
until, again, until we see, but there’s reason to think that those would be transient and would turn 
around. 
And another way to look at it is, there are models that look at inflation in different ways,
like—not models, but measures, like the Dallas trimmed mean, as I mentioned. So trimmed 
mean—it cuts off the big movements on the upside and the downside and looks at just the mean 
movements in inflation of various product categories and service categories, and it didn’t go 
down at all. It’s at 2 percent—or it’s at, I don’t know whether it went down or was above that, 
but it’s at 2 percent now. So there’s reason to think that these will be transient. 
We, of course, will be watching very carefully to see that that is the case. I would point 
to the case of cell phone services. Many of you will remember, in March of 2017, there was a ,very low reading for cell phone services—mobile phone services—and it was kind of a price 
war, and it dragged down core inflation for a full year, but it did not look like something that 
would be repeated. And we kind of thought so and said so, and then, sure enough, in 2018, we 
had those months of 2 percent inflation. 
So, again, we’ll have to see here. We’re going to be watching—really, I’d like to say 
we’re going to be watching inflation carefully to see that these things are transient, and I’ll end 
by saying we are strongly committed to the 2 percent inflation objective. 
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Just following up, Chair Powell. Nancy MarshallGenzer with Marketplace. You were saying if inflation does stay low and these low inflation 
rates are not transient, you said a couple times you’ll take that into account with monetary policy. 
How, specifically, will you take that into account? 
CHAIR POWELL. Yes, it’s hard to say, because there’s so many other variables. 
Ultimately, there are many variables to be taken into account at any given time, but that’s part of 
our mandate. Stable prices is half of our mandate, and we’ve defined that as 2 percent. So we
would be concerned, and we’d take it into account. 
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. So a cut in interest rates would be possible? 
CHAIR POWELL. I can’t really be any more specific than what I’ve said. 
JEAN YUNG. Hi, Jean Yung with Market News. If the fed funds rate keeps rising, do 
you see room for another IOER adjustment? And then, can you speak to any other strategies or 
tools that might be useful for keeping a ceiling on short-term interest rates? There have been 
other ideas floated, like the standing repo facility and targeting a different benchmark rate.,CHAIR POWELL. If we need to, and as needed, we will use our tools to keep the 
federal funds rate somewhere in the target range. We’ll do that. Don’t expect to need to do it 
again, but we don’t know. 
I mean, we’re—with—the balance sheet is now—the size of it is going to be driven by 
demand for liabilities, principally reserves, as I mentioned. And we’re right at that point where 
we’re starting to learn more and more about what the real demand for reserves is over the next 
few months. And so I—there is no template for this. There’s no roadmap. We just have to do it,
and that’s why we’re moving so very gradually. It’s why we tapered the roll-off to only 
$15 billion in Treasuries per month. Effective, I guess, today, we’re cutting the roll-off rate for 
Treasuries in half just because we want to take our time and move gradually here. So that’s that. 
In terms of other tools, we’re actually—I’m sure at an upcoming meeting we will be 
looking at the idea of a repo facility. I don’t have any presupposition that it’s something we 
would do, but we’ll be taking a look at it as a possible addition to our toolbox. Again, I wouldn’t 
say—it would just be a way for us to do what we do, which is to do a deep dive on it, think 
carefully about it, look at the pros and cons, look at the different possible ways to do it, and then 
go away and think about it for a little while. And then probably come back and make a decision. 
But that’s something we’ll do at an upcoming meeting, I would imagine. 
HANNAH LANG. Hannah Lang, American Banker. On the regulatory side, the Fed and 
other bank regulators are said to be weighing all options for retooling a proposal to revise the 
Volcker rule. Can you give any indication how close the agencies are to coming to a solution 
and what that solution might look like, whether it would be starting from scratch entirely or 
making changes to the original proposal? ,CHAIR POWELL. You know, we put out a proposal on Volcker some time ago, and we 
got a lot of comments, and we’re reviewing them carefully. I really don’t have a lot for you. I 
know they’re making good progress. I don’t really have a date though. And in terms of what all 
it’s going to be, it’s not something I can say with any certainty yet. 
BRIAN CHEUNG. Hi there. Brian Cheung with Yahoo Finance. So given what you’ve 
said about the expectations for consumption and also business fixed investment perhaps 
bouncing back in the next GDP reading, I’m wondering if you think that continued growth in 
economic activity might show some sort of underlying fundamental that could flag another 
overheating. For example, the median projection in the March meeting for GDP growth for 2019 
was 2.1, so I’m just kind of curious about what you see going forward if we continue to see 
strong GDP numbers. 
CHAIR POWELL. Well, we don’t see any evidence at all of overheating, for one thing. 
We see inflation below 2 percent now—as I mentioned, pretty close to 2 percent for most of last 
year. So, really, no signs of overheating. 
If you look at the labor market, for a long time now there have been anecdotal reports of 
labor shortages and difficulty in finding skilled labor and that kind of thing. Nonetheless, you 
have very strong job creation, and you have wages moving up at a rate that is appropriate, given 
inflation and given productivity, but not at all signaling any overheating at all. It’s not higher 
than that rate that would incorporate both inflation and productivity. So, really not seeing signs 
of overheating at the moment. 
HEATHER LONG. Are wages ever going to get back above 4 percent in this cycle? 
Can you kind of give us a read on—but more substantively, can you give us a read on how the 
Committee views productivity growth, if it’s accelerating enough? ,CHAIR POWELL. Yes—in terms of wages getting over 4 percent, wages have moved 
up pretty steadily over the last five years and are now—wages and benefits are now between 
3 and 3½ percent. Just for the last couple of years, the biggest part of the gains have come for 
people at the lowest end of compensation and education, which is kind of a welcome thing. 
You mentioned productivity. So productivity is really very difficult to predict. No one 
has been able to predict it successfully, so I won’t really try. But I will say this: Productivity 
was very, very low in the wake of the crisis for six or seven years. Last year, we had 1.9 percent 
productivity, which is much higher. I don’t know if that level can be sustained, but we really—
it’s driven, to some extent, by technological developments and, really, the diffusion of 
technology through the economy, and it’s very hard to predict. So I think it’s positive. 
In fact, I’ll mention, if we’re talking about the supply side, labor force participation. 
Really, there has been a significant positive supply-side development over the last year and a half 
between the uptick in labor force participation, which goes back several years, but also 
productivity. And that does suggest more room to grow. It suggests that a less tight economy, a 
less, you know—may be part of the explanation for lower inflation. 
Thanks very much.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20190501.pdf
2023-02-01,2023-02-01,"Transcript of Chair Powell’s Press Conference
February 1, 2023
CHAIR POWELL. Good afternoon, and welcome. My colleagues and I understand the 
hardship that high inflation is causing, and we are strongly committed to bringing inflation back 
down to our 2 percent goal. Over the past year, we have taken forceful actions to tighten the 
stance of monetary policy. We have covered a lot of ground, and the full effects of our rapid 
tightening so far are yet to be felt. Even so, we have more work to do. Price stability is the 
responsibility of the Federal Reserve and serves as the bedrock of our economy. Without price 
stability, the economy does not work for anyone. In particular, without price stability, we will 
not achieve a sustained period of labor market conditions that benefit all.
Today, the FOMC raised our policy interest rate by 25 basis points. We continue to 
anticipate that ongoing increases will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary 
policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time. In addition, we are 
continuing the process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet. Restoring price 
stability will likely require maintaining a restrictive stance for some time. I will have more to 
say about today’s monetary policy actions after briefly reviewing economic developments.
The U.S. economy slowed significantly last year, with real GDP rising at a below-trend 
pace of 1 percent. Recent indicators point to modest growth of spending and production this 
quarter. Consumer spending appears to be expanding at a subdued pace, in part reflecting tighter 
financial conditions over the past year. Activity in the housing sector continues to weaken, 
largely reflecting higher mortgage rates. Higher interest rates and slower output growth also 
appear to be weighing on business fixed investment.
Despite the slowdown in growth, the labor market remains extremely tight, with the 
unemployment rate at a 50-year low, job vacancies still very high, and wage growth elevated. ,Job gains have been robust, with employment rising by an average of 247,000 jobs per month 
over the last three months. Although the pace of job gains has slowed over the course of the past 
year and nominal wage growth has shown some signs of easing, the labor market continues to be 
out of balance. Labor demand substantially exceeds the supply of available workers, and the 
labor force participation rate has changed little from a year ago. 
Inflation remains well above our longer-run goal of 2 percent. Over the 12 months 
ending in December, total PCE prices rose 5.0 percent; excluding the volatile food and energy 
categories, core PCE prices rose 4.4 percent. The inflation data received over the past three 
months show a welcome reduction in the monthly pace of increases. And, while recent 
developments are encouraging, we will need substantially more evidence to be confident that 
inflation is on a sustained downward path. 
Despite elevated inflation, longer-term inflation expectations appear to remain well 
anchored, as reflected in a broad range of surveys of households, businesses, and forecasters, as 
well as measures from financial markets. But that’s not grounds for complacency. Although 
inflation has moderated recently, it remains too high. The longer the current bout of high 
inflation continues, the greater the chance that expectations of higher inflation will become 
entrenched. 
The Fed’s monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum 
employment and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware 
that high inflation imposes significant hardship, as it erodes purchasing power, especially for 
those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We 
are highly attentive to the risks that inflation poses to both sides of our mandate, and we are 
strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2 percent objective.,At today’s meeting, the Committee raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 
25 basis points, bringing the target range to 4½ to 4¾ percent. And we are continuing the 
process of significantly reducing the size of our balance sheet.
With today’s action, we have raised interest rates by 4½ percentage points over the past 
year. We continue to anticipate that ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds 
rate will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently 
restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.
We are seeing the effects of our policy actions on demand in the most interest-sensitive 
sectors of the economy, particularly housing. It will take time, however, for the full effects of 
monetary restraint to be realized, especially on inflation. In light of the cumulative tightening of 
monetary policy and the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, 
the Committee decided to raise interest rates by 25 basis points today, continuing the step-down 
from last year’s rapid pace of increases. Shifting to a slower pace will better allow the 
Committee to assess the economy’s progress toward our goals as we determine the extent of 
future increases that will be required to attain a sufficiently restrictive stance. We will continue 
to make our decisions meeting by meeting, taking into account the totality of incoming data and 
their implications for the outlook for economic activity and inflation.
We have been taking forceful steps to moderate demand so that it comes into better 
alignment with supply. Our overarching focus is using our tools to bring inflation back down to 
our 2 percent goal and to keep longer-term inflation expectations well anchored. Reducing 
inflation is likely to require a period of below-trend growth and some softening of labor market 
conditions. Restoring price stability is essential to set the stage for achieving maximum ,employment and stable prices over the longer run. The historical record cautions strongly 
against prematurely loosening policy. We will stay the course, until the job is done.
To conclude, we understand that our actions affect communities, families, and businesses 
across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission. We at the Fed will do 
everything we can to achieve our maximum-employment and price-stability goals. Thank you, 
and I look forward to your questions. 
MICHELLE SMITH. Chris.
CHRISTOPHER RUGABER. Chris Rugaber, the Associated Press. Thank you for 
doing this. As you know, financial conditions have loosened since the fall with bond yields 
falling, which has also brought down mortgage rates, and the stock market posted a solid gain in 
January. Does that make your job of combating inflation harder? And could you see lifting rates 
higher than you otherwise would to offset the increase in—or to offset the easing of financial 
conditions? 
CHAIR POWELL. So it is important that overall financial conditions continue to reflect 
the policy restraint that we’re putting in place in order to bring inflation down to 2 percent. And,
of course, financial conditions have tightened very significantly over the past year. I would say 
that our focus is not on short-term moves but on sustained changes to broader financial 
conditions. And it is our judgment that we’re not yet at a sufficiently restrictive policy stance, 
which is why we say that we expect ongoing hikes will be appropriate. Of course, many things 
affect financial conditions—not just our policy. And we will take into account overall financial 
conditions along with many other factors as we set policy.
MICHELLE SMITH. Rachel.,RACHEL SIEGEL. Hi, Chair Powell, thank you for taking our questions. Rachel Siegel 
from the Washington Post. Over the last quarter, we’ve seen a deceleration in prices, in wages,
and a fall in consumer spending, all while the unemployment rate has been able to stay at a 
historic low. Does this, at all, change your view of how much the unemployment rate would 
need to go up, if at all, to see inflation come down to the levels you’re looking for?
CHAIR POWELL. So I would say it is a good thing that the disinflation that we have 
seen so far has not come at the expense of a weaker labor market. But I would also say that that 
disinflationary process that you now see under way is really at an early stage. What you see is,
really, in the goods sector you see inflation now coming down because supply chains have been 
fixed, demand is shifting back to services, and shortages have been abated. So you see that. In 
the other—in the housing services sector, we expect inflation to continue moving up for a while 
but then to come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be 
lower. So, in those two sectors, you’ve got a good story. The issue is that we have a large sector 
called nonhousing service—core nonhousing services, where we don’t see disinflation yet. But I 
would say that, so far, what we see is progress but without any weakening in labor market 
conditions.
RACHEL SIEGEL. Has your—I’m sorry.
CHAIR POWELL. Go ahead.
RACHEL SIEGEL. Has your expectation for where the unemployment rate might go 
changed since December?
CHAIR POWELL. No. We’re going to write down new forecasts at the March meeting, 
and we’ll see at that time. I will say that it is gratifying to see the disinflationary process now ,getting under way, and we continue to get strong labor market data. So—but, you know, we’ll 
update those forecasts in March.
MICHELLE SMITH. Neil. 
NEIL IRWIN. Hi, Chair Powell. Neil Irwin with Axios. You and some of your 
colleagues have emphasized the possibility that job openings could come down and that would 
let some of the air out of the labor market without major job losses. We saw the opposite in the 
December JOLTS this morning. Job openings are actually rising. That also coincided with 
slowdown in wage inflation. Do you believe that openings are an important indicator to be 
studying to understand where the labor market is and where wage inflation might be heading?
CHAIR POWELL. So you’re right about the data, of course. What we did see—we’ve 
seen average hourly earnings and now the employment cost index abating a little bit still off of 
their highs of six months ago and more but still at levels that are fairly elevated. The job 
openings number has—in JOLTS, has been quite volatile recently. Yeah, I did see that it moved 
up—back up this morning. I do think that it’s probably an important indicator. The ratio, I 
guess, is back up to 1.9 job openings to unemployed people, people who are looking for work. 
So it’s an indicator, but nonetheless, we—you’re right, we do see wages moving down. If you 
look across the rest of the labor market, you still see very high payroll job creation. And, you 
know, quits are still at an elevated level. So many, many—by many, many indicators, the job 
market is still very strong.
MICHELLE SMITH. Colby, and then Howard.
COLBY SMITH. Thank you. Colby Smith with the Financial Times. Given the 
economic data since the December meeting, is the trajectory for the fed funds rate in the most ,recent SEP still the best guidepost for the policy path forward? Or does ongoing now mean more 
than two rate rises now? 
CHAIR POWELL. So you’re right. At the December meeting, we all wrote down our 
best estimates of what we thought the ultimate level would be, and that’s obviously back in 
December. And the median for that was between 5 and 5¼ percent. At the March meeting, 
we’re going to update those assessments. We did not update them today. We did, however, 
continue to say that we believe ongoing rate hikes will be appropriate to attain a sufficiently 
restrictive stance of policy to bring inflation back down to 2 percent. We think we’ve covered a 
lot of ground, and financial conditions have certainly tightened. I would say we still think 
there’s work to do there. We haven’t made a decision on exactly where that will be. I think, you 
know, we’re going to be looking carefully at the incoming data between now and the March 
meeting and then the May meeting. I don’t feel a lot of certainty about where that will be. It 
could certainly be higher than we’re writing down right now. If we come to the view that we 
need to write down to, you know, to move rates up beyond what we said in December, we would 
certainly do that. At the same time, if the data come in, in the other direction, then we’ll, you 
know, we’ll make data-dependent decisions at coming meetings, of course.
COLBY SMITH. Just as a quick follow-up, how are you viewing the kind of balance of 
risk between those two options of, you know, the likelihood of maybe falling short of that or 
going beyond that level?
CHAIR POWELL. I guess I would say it this way. I continue to think that it’s very 
difficult to manage the risk of doing too little and finding out in 6 or 12 months that we actually 
were close but didn’t get the job done. Inflation springs back, and we have to go back in. And 
now, you really do worry about expectations getting unanchored and that kind of thing. This is a ,very difficult risk to manage, whereas I—of course, we have no incentive and no desire to 
overtighten. But we, you know, if we feel like we’ve gone too far, we can certainly—and 
inflation is coming down faster than we expect, then we have tools that would work on that. So I 
do think that, in this situation, where we have still the highest inflation in 40 years, you know, 
the job is not fully done. As I started to mention earlier, we have a sector that represents 
56 percent of the core inflation index where we don’t see disinflation yet. So we don’t see it. 
It’s not happening yet. Inflation in the core services ex. housing is still running at 4 percent on a 
6- and 12-month basis. So there’s not—nothing happening there. In the other two sectors 
representing, you know, less than 50 percent, you actually, I think, now have a story that is 
credible, that’s coming together, although you don’t actually see disinflation yet in housing 
services, but it’s in the pipeline, right? So, for the third sector, we don’t see anything here. So I 
think it would be premature—it would be very premature to declare victory or to think that 
we’ve really got this. We need to see—our goal, of course, is to bring inflation down. And how 
do we get that done? There are many, many factors driving inflation in that sector, and they 
should be coming into play to have inflation—the disinflationary process begin in that sector.
But, so far, we don’t see that. And I think until we do, we see ourselves as having a lot of work 
left to do.
MICHELLE SMITH. Howard. 
HOWARD SCHNEIDER. Hi, Howard Schneider with Reuters, and thanks as usual. So 
I just wanted to connect a couple of dots here. The statement made a number of changes that 
seem to be saying things are getting better. You’re saying inflation has eased That’s new. 
You’ve taken out references to the war in Ukraine that’s causing price increases. You’ve taken 
out references to the pandemic. You’ve eliminated all the reasons that you said prices were ,being driven higher, yet that’s not mapping to any change in how you describe policy. We still 
have ongoing increases to come. So I’m wondering, why is that the case? And does it have 
more to do with uncertainty around the outlook or more to do with you not wanting to give a 
very overeager market a reason to get ahead of itself and overreact?
CHAIR POWELL. So I guess I would say it this way. We can now say, I think, for the 
first time that the disinflationary process has started. We can see that. And we see it, really, in 
goods prices so far. Goods prices is a big sector. We—this is what we thought would happen 
since the very beginning, and now here it is actually happening, and for the reasons we thought.
We—you know, it’s supply chains, it’s shortages, and it’s demand revolving back towards 
services. So this is a good thing. This is a good thing. But that’s, you know, around a quarter of 
the PCE price index—core PCE price index. So the second sector is housing services, and that’s 
driven by very different things. And we—as I mentioned, with housing services, we expect, and 
other forecasters expect, that measured inflation will continue moving up for several months but 
will then come down, assuming that [rent increases associated with] new leases continue to be 
soft. And we do assume that. So we think that that’s sort of in the pipeline. And we actually see 
disinflation in the goods sector, and we see it in the pipeline for two sectors that amount to a little 
less than half. So this is good. And we note that when we say inflation is coming down that this 
is good. We expect to see that that disinflation process will be seen, we hope soon, in the core 
goods ex. housing—sorry, the core services ex. housing sector that I talked about. We don’t see 
it yet. It’s—you know, it’s seven or eight different kinds of services, not all of them are the 
same. And, you know, we have a sense of what’s going on in each of those different 
subsections. Probably the biggest part of it, probably 60 percent of that is, you know, research 
would show is sensitive to slack in the economy and so the labor market will probably be ,important. Some of the other ones it’s—the labor market is not going to be important. Many 
other factors will drive it. In any case, we don’t see disinflation in that sector yet. And I think 
we need to see that it’s the majority of the core PCE index, which is the thing that we think is the 
best predictor of headline PCE, which is [the price series that we associate with] our mandate.
So it’s not that we’re not—we’re neither optimistic nor pessimistic. We’re just telling you that 
we don’t see inflation moving down yet in that large sector. I think we will fairly soon, but we 
don’t see it yet. Until we do, I think we—you know, we see ourselves, we’ve got to be honest 
with ourselves, but we see ourselves as having perhaps more persistent—we’ll see more 
persistent inflation in that sector, which will take longer to get down. And we’re just going to
have to—we have to complete the job. You know, that’s what we’re here for.
MICHELLE SMITH. Nick. 
NICK TIMIRAOS. Nick Timiraos, the Wall Street Journal. Chair Powell, you observed 
several years ago that we learned we can have a low unemployment rate without above-target 
inflation. And we have learned lately that inflation can come down from its uncomfortably high 
level despite a historically low unemployment rate. Given that, and given how much you did 
over the last year, why do you think further rate increases are needed? Why not stop here and 
see what transpires in the coming months before raising rates again?
CHAIR POWELL. So we’ve—you know, we’ve raised rates 4½ percentage points, and 
we’re talking about a couple of more rate hikes to get to that level we think is appropriately 
restrictive. And why do we think that’s probably necessary? We think, because inflation is still 
running very hot. We’re, of course, taking into account long and variable lags, and we’re 
thinking about that. It really—the story we’re telling about inflation is to ourselves, and the way 
we understand it is basically the three things that I’ve just gone through a couple of times. And,,again, we don’t see it affecting the services sector ex. housing yet. But, I mean, I think our 
assessment is that we’re not very far from that level. We don’t know that, though. We don’t 
know that. So I think we’re—you know, we’re living in a world of significant uncertainty. I 
would look across the rate—the spectrum of rates and see that real rates are now positive by—
you know, by an appropriate set of measures are positive across the yield curve. I think policy is 
restrictive. We’re trying to make a fine judgment about how much is restrictive enough. That’s 
all. And we’re going to—you know, that’s why we’re slowing down to 25 basis points. We’re 
going to be carefully watching the economy and watching inflation and watching the progress of 
the disinflationary process.
NICK TIMIRAOS. Did you or your colleagues discuss the conditions for a pause at this 
meeting this week?
CHAIR POWELL. We—you know, you’ll see that the minutes will come out in three 
weeks, and we’ll give you a lot of detail. I—you know, we spend a lot of time talking about the 
path ahead and the state of the economy. And I wouldn’t want to start to drive the—describe all 
the details there, but that was the sense of the discussion, was really talking quite a bit about the 
path forward.
MICHELLE SMITH. Victoria. 
VICTORIA GUIDA. Hi, Chair Powell. I wanted to ask about the debt ceiling. Given 
that we’ve now hit up against it, I was wondering if the U.S. goes past the X date, will the Fed do 
whatever the Treasury directs as it relates to making payments as the fiscal agent or will it do its 
own analysis of any legal constraints?
CHAIR POWELL. So your question is, would we—say your question again.,VICTORIA GUIDA. Will the Fed do what Treasury directs as it relates to making 
payments or will it do its own analysis of any legal constraints?
CHAIR POWELL. So you’re really asking about—you’re asking about prioritization, in 
effect, is what—
VICTORIA GUIDA. Yes. Yes. 
CHAIR POWELL. Okay. So I feel like I have to say this. There’s only one way 
forward here, and that is for Congress to raise the debt ceiling so that the United States 
government can pay all of its obligations when due. And any deviations from that path would be 
highly risky and that no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the 
consequences of failing to act in a timely manner.
In terms of our relationship with the Treasury, we are their fiscal agent. And I’m just 
going to leave it at that.
VICTORIA GUIDA. Are you actively doing any planning of what might happen in the 
event that that would happen?
CHAIR POWELL. I’m just going to leave it at that. This is a matter that’s to be 
resolved between, really—it’s really Congress’ job to raise the debt ceiling. And I gather there 
are discussions happening, but they don’t involve us. We’re not involved in those discussions. 
So we’re the fiscal agent.
MICHELLE SMITH. Jeanna and then Steve. 
JEANNA SMIALEK. Jeanna Smialek from the New York Times. Thanks for taking our 
questions. I wonder, was there any discussion today of the possibility of pausing rate increases 
and then restarting them? Lorie Logan from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas seemed to ,suggest that would be a possibility in a recent speech. And I wonder if that view is broadly 
shared on the Committee.
CHAIR POWELL. So the Committee obviously did not see this as the time to pause. 
We judged that the appropriate, you know, thing to do at this meeting was to raise the federal 
funds rate by 25 basis points. And we said that we continue to anticipate that ongoing increases 
in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain that stance of sufficiently restrictive 
monetary policy that will bring inflation down to 2 percent. So that’s the judgment that we 
made. You know, we’re going to write down new forecasts in March, and we’ll—you know, 
we’ll certainly be looking at the incoming data as everyone else will.
JEANNA SMIALEK. Sorry, I should have been clearer. I mean, would it be possible to 
take a meeting off, for example, and then resume? You know, could you, rather than just doing 
at every meeting that move, go a little bit more slowly, take some gaps in between moves?
CHAIR POWELL. I mean, I think this is not something that the Committee is thinking 
about or exploring in any kind of detail. In principle, though, you know, we used to—the thing 
we used to do was go every other meeting, if you remember, 25 basis points, and that was 
considered a fast pace. So I think a lot of options are available. And I mean, you saw what the 
Bank of Canada did and, you know, they left it that they’re willing to raise rates after pausing. 
But this is not something that the Federal Open Market Committee is on the point of deciding 
right now.
MICHELLE SMITH. Steve. 
STEVE LIESMAN. Steve Liesman, CNBC. Mr. Chairman, the SEP has the PCE 
inflation rate in 2023 at 3.1 percent. Meanwhile, the three-month annualized PCE is 2.1 percent,
and you’ve achieved this without going to your 5.1 percent funds rate, which is what you have ,penciled in for this year. And you’ve also achieved it without the 1 percentage point increase in 
the unemployment rate, which you have penciled in for this year. I’m wondering if you’ve 
considered the idea of whether or not your understanding of the inflation dynamic may be wrong,
and it’s possible to achieve these things without raising rates that high and also without the surge 
in unemployment.
And, specifically, I wonder if you might comment on the speech given by Vice Chair 
Lael Brainard, who said, “To the extent that inputs other than wages may be responsible in part 
for important price increases for some nonhousing services, an unwinding of these factors.” In 
other words, it may not be wages. The idea that it may not require unemployment rising to get 
this sector of inflation under control. Thanks.
CHAIR POWELL. So a couple of things. First, on the forecast, if—you’re right—if you 
take very short-term three-month, say, measures of PCE—core PCE inflation, they’re quite low 
right now. But that’s because that’s driven by, you know, significantly negative readings from 
goods inflation. Most forecasters would think that the significantly negative readings will be 
transitory and that goods inflation will move up fairly soon, back up to its longer-run trend of 
something around zero, something like that. So a lot of forecasts would call for core PCE to go 
back up to 4 percent by the middle of the year, for example. So that’s really where the 
sustainable level is. It’s more like at 4 percent. So that would suggest there’s work left to do. 
You know, let’s say inflation does come down much faster than we expect, which is possible.
As I mentioned, you know, obviously our policy is data dependent. We would take that into 
account.
In terms of the non—sorry, the core nonhousing services, as I mentioned earlier, it’s a 
very diverse sector, six or seven sectors. And so sectors that represent 55 or 60 percent of that—,subsectors of that sector are—we think are sensitive to slack in the economy, sensitive to the 
labor market in a way, but some of the other sectors are not. And, for example, you know, 
financial services is a big sector that’s really not driven by labor markets—wages. So that’s why 
I said there are a number of things that will affect—take restaurants, right? So, clearly, labor is 
important for restaurants but so are food prices. And, you know, transportation services is going 
to be driven by fuel prices, for example. So there are lots of things in that mix that will drive 
inflation. I would say overall, though, my own view would be that you’re not going to have, you 
know, a sustainable return to 2 percent inflation in that sector without a better balance in the 
labor market. And I don’t know what that will require in terms of increased unemployment, your 
question. I do think there are a number of dimensions through which the labor market can 
soften. And so far, we’ve got—as I mentioned, in goods, we have inflation moving down 
without the softening in the labor market. I think most forecasters would say that unemployment 
will probably rise a bit from here. But I still think—I continue to think that there’s a path to 
getting inflation back down to 2 percent without a really significant economic decline or a 
significant increase in unemployment. And that’s because the—you know, the setting we’re in is 
quite different. The inflation that we originally got was very much a collision between very 
strong demand and hard supply constraints, not something that you really have seen in prior—
you know, in prior business cycles. And so now we see goods inflation coming down for the 
reasons we thought, and we understand why housing inflation will come down. And I think 
will—a story will emerge on the nonhousing services sector soon enough. But I think there is—
there’s ongoing disinflation, and we don’t yet see weakening in the labor market. So we’ll have 
to see.
STEVE LIESMAN. Can we get there with 5 percent? ,CHAIR POWELL. Certainly possible. Yeah. Absolutely it’s possible. You know, it’s a 
question—no one really knows. I think it’s because this is not like the other business cycles in 
so many ways. It may well be that as—yeah, as—that it will take more slowing than we 
expect—than I expect to get inflation down to 2 percent. But I don’t—that’s not my base case. 
My base case is that the economy can return to 2 percent inflation without a really significant 
downturn or a really big increase in unemployment. I think that’s a possible outcome. I think 
many, many forecasters would say it’s not the most likely outcome. But I would say there’s a 
chance of it. 
MICHELLE SMITH. Michael. 
MICHAEL MCKEE. Michael McKee from Bloomberg TV and Radio. I’d like to pick 
up on what you were just saying about a substantial downturn and ask, with the full weight of 
your tightening not in place yet and with the progress against inflation, there’s still a lot of talk 
about very, very slow growth going forward in 2023. And the recession indicators are all 
suggesting that we are going to see recession this year. So I’m wondering if you’ve changed 
your view or you have a more nuanced view of what you think the danger to economic growth is 
going forward and whether you’re very close to perhaps tipping it into the wrong place, which 
calls for more restraint on your part. 
CHAIR POWELL. So I do think you—most forecasts and, you know, my own 
assessment would be that that growth will continue—positive growth will continue but at a 
subdued pace as it did last year. We had growth of—GDP growth of 1 percent last year and also 
final sales growth, which we think is a better indicator, of about 1 percent. I think, you know, 
most forecasts and certainly my assessment would be that growth will continue at a fairly 
subdued level this year. There are other factors, though, that need to be considered. You will ,have seen that the global picture is improving a bit, and that will matter for us, potentially. The 
labor market remains very, very strong, and that’s job creation, that’s wages. As inflation does 
come down, sentiment will improve. You also—state and local governments are really flush 
these days with, you know, money, and many of them are considering tax cuts or even sending 
checks. So I think that’s going to support—they’re also spending a lot. There’s a lot of spending 
coming in the construction pipeline, both private and public. And so that’s going to support 
economic activity. So I think there’s a good chance that those factors will help support positive 
growth this year. And that’s my base case, is that there will be positive growth this year. 
MICHELLE SMITH. Okay, Rich.
RICH MILLER. Thank you. Rich Miller from Bloomberg. First off, how are you 
doing?
CHAIR POWELL. Fine. Thanks. Fine.
RICH MILLER. Good. Second off, I think, earlier on in the press conference, you said 
you need to see substantially more evidence of inflation coming down. Can you give us some 
idea of what you’re thinking of? You mentioned three months—that we’ve seen three months in 
a row. Governor Waller suggested he might want to see six months. And so is it just the 
inflation data, or do you have to see the labor market coming back into better balance to have 
that “substantially more evidence” metric?
CHAIR POWELL. So I don’t think there’s, you know, going to be a light switch flipped 
or anything like that. I think it’s just an accumulating—accumulation of evidence. So, of 
course, we’ll be looking—by the time of the March meeting, we’ll have two more employment 
reports, two more CPI reports, and we’ll be looking at those carefully as all of us will. And we’ll 
be asking ourselves, what are they telling us? And soon after that, we’ll have another ECI wage ,report, which, as you know, is a report that we like because it adjusts for composition and it’s 
very complete. And, you know, the one we got, I guess it was yesterday, was some—was 
constructive. It’s—you know, it shows wages coming down but still at a high level. They’re 
still at a level that’s way above—well above where they were before the pandemic. So I don’t 
want to put a number on it in terms of months, but as the accumulated evidence comes in, it’s 
going to be reflected in our assessment of the outlook, and that will be reflected in our policy 
over time. But I will say, though, we—you know, it is our job to restore price stability and 
achieve 2 percent inflation for the benefit of the American public. We’re not—market 
participants have a very different job. It’s a fine job. It’s a great job. In fact, I did that job for 
years but in one form or another. But, you know, we have to deliver that. And so we are 
strongly resolved that we will, you know, complete this task because we think it has benefits that 
will, you know, support economic activity and benefit the public for many, many years.
MICHELLE SMITH. Edward. 
EDWARD LAWRENCE. Thank you, Michelle. Thank you, Fed Chairman, for taking 
the questions. So you’ve talked about we had solid job growth. Edward Lawrence from Fox 
Business, by the way. We had solid job growth, a slight falling in the increase in consumer 
spending. It seems so far it’s been relatively mild from the economy to go to—from a 
9.1 percent CPI inflation to 6.5 percent CPI inflation. Is the hard part yet to come to go from 
6.5 to 2?
CHAIR POWELL. I don’t think we know, honestly. You know, the—so we, of course, 
expected goods inflation to start coming down by the end of 2021, and it didn’t come down all 
through ’22. And now it’s coming down, and it’s come down pretty fast. So I would say these 
are—this is not a standard business cycle where you can look at the last 10 times there was a ,global pandemic and we shut the economy down and Congress did what it did and we did what 
we did. It’s just—it’s unique. So I think certainty is just not appropriate here. Inflation—it’s 
just harder to forecast inflation. It may come down faster. It may take longer to come down. 
And, you know, our job is to deliver inflation back to target, and we will do that. But I think 
we’re going to be cautious about declaring victory and, you know, sending signals that we think 
that the game is won because, you know, it’s—we’ve got a long way to go. It’s just—it’s the 
early stages of disinflation. And it’s most welcome to be able to say that we are now in 
disinflation, but that’s great. But we just see that it has to spread through the economy and that 
it’s going to take some time. That’s all.
EDWARD LAWRENCE. Do you—how long do you see then, the federal funds rate 
remaining at this elevated level?
CHAIR POWELL. You know, so—again, my forecast and that of my colleagues as you 
will see from the SEP and—I mean, there are many different forecasts, but, generally, it’s a 
forecast of slower growth, some softening in labor market conditions, and inflation moving down 
steadily but not quickly. And, in that case, if the economy performs broadly in line with those 
expectations, it will not be appropriate to cut rates this year, to loosen policy this year. Of 
course, other people have forecasts with inflation coming down much faster, that’s a different 
thing. You know, if that happens—inflation comes down much faster, you know, then we’ll be 
seeing that, and it will be incorporated into our thinking about policy.
MICHELLE SMITH. Simon. 
SIMON RABINOVITCH. Thank you, Chair Powell. Simon Rabinovitch with the 
Economist. May I ask a further question about the language around “ongoing increases?” That, 
of course, implies at least two further rate rises. If you look at fed fund and futures pricing, the ,implication is that you’ll raise rates one more time and then pause. Are you concerned about that 
divergence or do you think, if everything breaks right, is that a plausible outcome?
CHAIR POWELL. I’m not particularly concerned about the divergence, no, because it is 
largely due to the market’s expectation that inflation will move down more quickly. I think 
that’s the bigger part of that. So, again, as I just mentioned, we—you know, our forecasts—
different participants have different forecasts, but, generally, those forecasts are for continued 
subdued growth, some softening in the labor market but not a recession, not a recession. And we 
have inflation moving down, you know, into the—somewhere in the mid-threes or maybe lower 
than that this year. We’ll update that in March, but that’s what we thought in December. 
Markets are past that. They show inflation coming down, in some cases, much quicker than that. 
So we’ll just have to see. And we have a different view and—a different view, it’s a different 
forecast, really. And given our outlook, I just—I don’t see us cutting rates this year if we get—if 
our outlook turns true, as I mentioned just now. If we do see inflation coming down much more 
quickly, that’ll play into our policy setting, of course. 
MICHELLE SMITH. Scott. 
SCOTT HORSLEY. Hi, Chair Powell. Scott Horsley from NPR. One of the changes in 
the statement this month is that the Committee is no longer listing public health as among the 
data points you’ll consider in assessing conditions. What should we make of that? Does the 
Federal Reserve no longer see the pandemic as weighing on the economy? 
CHAIR POWELL. That’s the general sense of it. Look, we understand—I personally 
understand well that COVID is still out there, but that it’s no longer playing an important role in 
our economy. And, you know, we’ve kept that statement in there for quite a while, and I think 
we just—we knew we would take it out at some point. There’s never a perfect time, but we ,thought that—you know, people are handling it better, and the economy and the society are 
handling it better now. It doesn’t really need to be in a—you know, in the Fed’s monthly, you 
know, postmeeting statement as an ongoing economic risk as opposed to, you know, a health 
issue.
MICHELLE SMITH. Nancy. 
NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. Hi, Chair Powell. Nancy Marshall-Genzer with 
Marketplace. I wanted to go back to another thing that Fed Vice Chair Lael Brainard said 
recently. She said she doesn’t see signs of a wage–price spiral, and I’m wondering if you agree 
with that.
CHAIR POWELL. I do. Yeah, I do. You don’t see that yet. But the whole point is, you 
know, if you—once you see it, you have a serious problem. That means that, effectively, in 
people’s decisionmaking, inflation has become a really salient issue. And once that happens—
that’s what we can’t allow to happen. And, you know, so that’s why we worry that the longer 
we’re at this and the longer people are talking about inflation all day long, every day, you know, 
the more risk of something like that. But no, there’s not much—it’s more of a risk. It always 
has been more of a risk than anything else. By the way, I think it’s becoming less salient. And 
people are—you know, we pick that up in conversations. And I’ve seen some data, too, that 
show people are, you know, gradually—they’re glad that inflation is coming down. People 
really don’t like inflation. And as we see it coming down, that could also add a boost to 
economic activity. You look at the sentiment surveys now, and they’re very, very low with 
3½ percent unemployment and, you know, high wage increases nominally by historical 
standards. Why can that be? It has to be inflation, right? So I think once inflation is seen to be 
coming down in coming months, even you will also see a boost to sentiment, I hope. ,NANCY MARSHALL-GENZER. So that’s what you’re looking at most closely, is 
consumer expectations? 
CHAIR POWELL. That’s at the very heart, is consumers and businesses that, you know, 
are the—essentially, we believe that expectations of future inflation are a very important part of 
the process of creating inflation. That’s a sort of bedrock belief. In one way or another, it has to 
be. We think it’s important. And, in this case, I would say, the risk eight months ago or so, 
longer-term inflation expectations had moved up. We moved quite vigorously last year. 
Expectations are—seem to be well anchored, including at the shorter end now, not just the longer 
end. So it’s, you know—and that’s—I think that’s very reassuring. I think, you know, the 
markets have decided, and the public has decided, that inflation is going to come back down to 
2 percent and it’s just a matter of us following through. That's immeasurably helpful to the 
process of getting inflation down. The fact that people now do generally believe that it will 
come down, that’ll be part of the process of getting it down. And it’s a very positive thing.
MICHELLE SMITH. Greg. 
GREG ROBB. Thank you, Chair Powell. Greg Robb from MarketWatch. In the 
minutes of the December meeting, there was a couple of sentences that struck people as 
important, when the Committee said participants talked about this unwarranted easing of 
financial conditions was a risk and it would make your life harder to bring inflation down. I 
haven’t seen—heard you talk much about that today or in the statement. So I was wondering, 
has that concern eased among members, or is that still something you’re concerned about? 
Thank you.
CHAIR POWELL. I would put it this way. It’s something that we monitor carefully. 
Financial conditions didn’t really change much from the December meeting to now. They ,mostly went sideways or up and down but came out in roughly the same place. It’s important 
that the markets do reflect the tightening that we’re putting in place. As we’ve discussed a 
couple times here, there’s a difference in perspective by some market measures on how fast 
inflation will come down. We’re just going to have to see. I mean, I’m not going to try to 
persuade people to have a different forecast, but our forecast is that it will take some time and 
some patience and that we’ll need to keep rates higher for longer. But we’ll see.
MICHELLE SMITH. Brendan, for the last question. 
BRENDAN PEDERSEN. Hi, Chair Powell. Brendon Pedersen with Punchbowl News. 
I wanted to ask if the Fed takes into account at all the debt ceiling when it comes to quantitative 
tightening, given the fact that rapid or faster quantitative tightening could bring us closer, faster 
to that drop-dead debt ceiling deadline. Could it play in effect as we get closer to that drop-dead 
deadline this summer?
CHAIR POWELL. Look, I—it’s very hard to think about all the different possible 
ramifications. And I think the answer is, basically, I don’t think there’s likely to be any 
important interaction between the two, because I believe Congress will wind up acting, and—as 
it will and must, in the end, to raise the debt ceiling in a way that doesn’t risk, you know, the 
progress we’re making against inflation and the economy and the financial sector. I believe that 
that will happen. I believe it will happen. You know, we, of course, will monitor money market 
conditions carefully as—you know, as the process moves on. For example, the Treasury General 
Account will shrink down, and then it will grow back up. And we understand there’ll be lots of 
flows between there and the overnight repo facility and reserves. We understand all that. We’re 
watching it carefully. We’ll just be monitoring it.
Thank you very much.",https://www.federalreserve.gov/mediacenter/files/FOMCpresconf20230201.pdf
